# BasicRankingSystem

The goal of this project is to construct a Ranking system formula inspired by the
Sonic Heroes result screen when you finish a level.

This simple ranking system calculates your results based on a precentage of a combination
of different points (similar to how you would get graded on a module at school/Uni, 40% exam
and 60% coursework).

### reprecentations:
* fish     = 40%
* distance = 60% | Total = 40% + 60% = 100%

Note: 
This code was constructed back in 2017 to test the ranking system I was 
working on for a cancelled game at the time, more info regarding this:
